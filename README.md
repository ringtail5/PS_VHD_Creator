# PS_VHD_Creator
 PowerShell Script that creates identical virtual hard drives and can add them to an existing VM.

This script was created to quickly and easily make numerous virtual hard drives and adds them to a VM (if so desired).

This was useful when learning how to manage volumes in the VMs by providing many drives to group as spanned, mirrored, or RAID volumes.

And it is my first PowerShell script.  :P
